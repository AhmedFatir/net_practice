Application Layer: decide the protocol working one: https ftp ssh ... using DNS(NAT) and DHCP

Presentation Layer : ->data translation to binary 
					 -> data compression
					 -> data encryption(html and js file to XML)
					 ->and then the receiver decrypts it using SSL

Session Layer:  ->transmission mode -> 1 simplex:
  									-> 2 half-duplex:
									-> 3 full-duplex:
				-> authentication: login mdp ...
				-> Authorization: permissions and accessibility
				-> Session management: cash

Transport Layer: ->segmentation: divide data into small segments every segment has a port number and a sequence number
				 -> and then when it receives integration of the data happens
				 ->flow control(transfer rate)
				 -> Determine the using protocol: TCP, UDP

Network Layer: 	->logical addressing: take the data from the transport layer and add the IP of the sender and the receiver (packet)
				->routing: chose the best road to transfer the data using some protocols(RIP, OSPF..)

Data link layer: ->physical addressing: tack the packet and add the MAC address of the sender and the receiver (Frame encapsulation)
				 -> farming = head(MAC) and trailer(checksum), access fo media for upper layers
				 -> Error detection and correction:
				 -> CSMA: controle the media link to avoid the data corruption
				 -> In the receiver it compares the Mac address

Physical Layer: ->hardware:  type of connection: Copper Cables, Twisted Pair, Fiber Optic Cables, Wireless…..
				->bit transmition: voltage, speed, frequency…
				->Physical Topology:  bus, star, ring, or mesh….
				->Physical Interfaces: Ports, Duplex, LEDs….
